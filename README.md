# ⚡ Grid Optimization & Energy Data Analytics

Welcome to my personal project repository — a deep dive into data analytics, forecasting, and optimization in the context of energy systems and smart grids.

---

## 📌 Objective

To become proficient in **data analytics for grid optimization**, with hands-on practice in:

- Load forecasting
- Building clustering
- Time-of-Use (TOU) energy cost optimization
- Load shifting and scheduling
- System-level simulation and control

---

## 🗺️ Learning Roadmap

### ✅ Stage 1: Python & Data Foundations
- Cleaned and visualized time-series load data
- Explored usage patterns across hours, days, and months

### ✅ Stage 2: Energy Load Profiling & Clustering
- Created calendar heatmaps and time-of-day plots
- Clustered buildings by load shape using KMeans and PCA
- Interpreted patterns for residential, office, and parking garages

### ✅ Stage 3: Forecasting & Load Optimization
- Forecasted building demand using `Prophet` and `XGBoost`
- Evaluated models (RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
- Simulated load shifting under TOU pricing
- Built linear programming models using `cvxpy`

### 🚀 Stage 4 (In Progress): Grid-Aware Optimization
- Multi-building load coordination
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Battery + flexible load co-optimization
- Reinforcement Learning for smart load agents
